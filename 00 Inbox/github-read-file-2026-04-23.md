## What this system is

Sanctum + Bifrost is a human-orchestrated agent operating system.

- **Sanctum** (`sanctum/`) — the compiled knowledge wiki. Private repo.
- **Bifrost** (`bifrost/`) — the schema and operating system for agents. Public repo.
- **Runestone** (`runestone/`) — the design identity browser. Built in Phase 1.

The human orchestrates. Agents execute. No agent selects the next agent.
No agent modifies another agent's output without being explicitly dispatched.

## Canonical vocabulary

Use these terms exactly. Do not substitute synonyms.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Rune | A named, versioned design identity in Sanctum |
| Design Contract | A project-specific file instanced from a Rune (`DESIGN_[PROJECT].md`) |
| Runestone | The browsable Rune library interface |
| Promote Gate | Human review step before agent output becomes durable knowledge |
| Inbox | `sanctum/00 Inbox/` — where all agent output lands first |
| Loop-back | Quality gate wrapper that retries agents on failure |
| Domain Deepening | research → model → validate → spec, applied per domain |

## Reserved names — never use as system components

- **Codex** — this is the harness name (OpenAI). Not a system component.
- **Forge** — belongs to Ropau's public system.
- All Ropau Rune names: Argent Décisif, Néon Humaniste, Signal Brut,
  Encre Éditoriale, Aube Opérative, Cristal Cartographique, Encre Souveraine,
  Flux Bienveillant, Prisme Analytique, Toile Narrative, Crimson Rain.
  These are their intellectual property. Do not use them as our own.

## Rules — read before every task

**Copy, never regenerate canonical files.**
If a task involves placing a known file into the system, copy it verbatim.
Do not summarise it, rewrite it, or regenerate it from memory.
After copying, verify by checking line count and grepping for a specific
known string from the file.

**One thing at a time.**
Complete one file or one action fully before moving to the next.
Report the result of each step individually.

**Write to Inbox first.**
All agent output goes to `sanctum/00 Inbox/` before any human review.
Nothing is promoted to `10 Knowledge/` or `30 Memory/` by the agent.
The human promotes.

**Never collapse the repo split.**
Sanctum and Bifrost are separate git repos. Never suggest merging them.
Runestone is a separate directory, not a subdirectory of either repo.

**Verification is mandatory.**
After every file write, verify the file exists at the correct path.
After every copy, verify the content matches the source by line count
and spot-check.

**Never invent vocabulary.**
If a term is not in the canonical vocabulary above or in the system
glossary, do not introduce it. Surface the gap instead.

**99 Templates/ is the format reference.**
Every new skill uses `sanctum/99 Templates/SKILL.md` as its template.
Every new Rune uses `sanctum/99 Templates/rune.md`.
Every new session summary uses `sanctum/99 Templates/session-summary.md`.

## Context boot for every session

Read these files in this order before beginning any implementation work:

1. This file (`bifrost/CODEX.md`)
2. `bifrost/system-spec-v0.3.md`
3. `bifrost/AGENTS.md`
4. `sanctum/AGENTS.md`
5. The relevant skill or contract for the current task

Do not begin work until you have read all five.

---

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — Foundation.**

What is done:
- Repos scaffolded
- Canonical files committed to both repos
- Press Rune written
- Design pipeline contract written
- Five design SKILL.md files written
- DESIGN_RUNESTONE.md instanced from Press
- Session summary ingested into 40 Sources/

What remains in Phase 0:
- 99 Templates/ populated (all template files)
- GitHub read skills written (github/read-file)
- Manual loop closed once end-to-end: dispatch one skill, output lands
  in Inbox, human promotes — before any automation is added

Do not proceed to Phase 1 work (Runestone build, dialogue skill,
harvester skill) until the manual loop is proven.

---

## When in doubt

Stop. Write your uncertainty to `sanctum/00 Inbox/harness-feedback.md`.
Do not guess. Do not expand scope. Surface the question and wait.
